  ===================================================
  It looks like spec_helper.rb has been loaded
  multiple times. Normalize the require to:

    require "spec/spec_helper"

  Things like File.join and File.expand_path will
  cause it to be loaded multiple times.

  Loaded this time from:

    #{e.backtrace.join("\n    ")}
